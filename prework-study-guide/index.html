        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and defines the structure and content of a web page.</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of <i>elements</i>. An <i>element</i> is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. The following metadata tags can be used inside the <i>head</i> element:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <i>title</i> element defines the title for a webpage. It is required and important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</li>
                  <li>The <i>style</i> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                  <li>The <i>link</i> element connects an external resource to the HTML doc.</li>
                  <li>The <i>meta</i> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                  <li>The <i>script</i> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML doc.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>The <i>h1</i>, <i>h2</i>, <i>h3</i>, <i>h4</i>, <i>h5</i>, and <i>h6</i> elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
                  <li>The <i>p</i> element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
                  <li>The <i>ul</i>, <i>ol</i>, and <i>li</i> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. They represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
                  <li>The <i>img</i> element contains info about images that are displayed on the webpage and can contain various attributes. The <i>src</i> attribute is the most important.</li>
                  <li>The <i>br</i> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
                  <li>The <i>a</i> (anchor) element creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The <i>href</i> <b>attribute</b> points to the URL for the link.</li>
                  <li><i>Section</i> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content. This element can contain a <i>class</i> and <i>id</i> <b>attribute</b>.</li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>Some commonly used element types are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Text elements</li>
              <li>Image elements</li>
              <li>Header elements</li>
              <li>List elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>There are also elements that are used to devide content on a page. Those commonly used are:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Meta-related elements</li>
              <li>Content division elements</li>
              <li>Semantic elements</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive, but HTML elements are. </li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional info about an element. Attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a programming language used to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Styles an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>These styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
              <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible because each inline style must be edited individually when making design changes.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Internal CSS: Contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The rules only apply to that page.</li>
              <li>You can configure CSS classes and IDs to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
              <li>A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>External CSS: The most common method to style a webpage.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>External CSS allows developers to keep their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>An external CSS file needs to be linked to the HTML file by placing a link element in HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Example: color:blue;</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules or declarations will apply.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>You can style HTML elements using the elements or class attributes as a selector.</li>
                <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma. This helps write <i>DRY</i> code.</li>
              </ul>
          <li>"*" applies a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>CSS rules can also be applied to images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: Checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: Creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>git checkout main: Takes you back to the main branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A: Adds all modifications to the current branch.</li>
          <li>git commit -m: Creates a commit. The -m flag associates a message with the commit.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: pulls down the latest main branch from the remote repository and integrates it into the local repository.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: Pushes up the changes from the local repository to the remote repository.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Control flow can be interrupted. Conditional statements and loops can control the order in which code is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The <i>const</i> keyword creates variables that can't be reassigned a value. It "locks down" the variable. It's followed by a variable name, an assignment operator, and the data to be stored. Always start by declaring varibles using this keyword when writing JavaScript.</li>
          <li>The <i>let</i> keyword is also used for variable declaration.</li>
          <li>The <i>function</i> keyword creates a function. A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. 
            <ul>
              <li>However, just because it is declared <u>does not</u> mean the code will execute. Functions must be called for the code to execute. To call a function, use the name of the function where you want the code to execute.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The <i>script</i> element that links the script.js file to the index.html file goes in the <i>body</i> element.</li>
          <li>An <i>array</i> is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. It can store different types of data like strings, numbers, etc. They are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>An <i>index</i> is the location number of data in an array. Also, arrays have a property called <i>length</i> which is equal to the number of items in the array.</li>
          <li>A <i>for loop</i> uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The <i>console.log</i> method can be used to output messages to the web console by adding an argument. It will output the value of the argument inside the parentheses to the web console. Ex: console.log(argument);</li>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Console</b> refers to a test environment used to check code. The second part <b>.log()</b>, means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>In an <i>if statement</i>, one or more conditions are provided for the computer to evaluate. If one contition is true, the code provided between the curly brackets will be executed. If the condition is false the code will not execute and will interrupt control flow.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>else if</i> can be used if more than one condition is needed.</li>
            </ul>
